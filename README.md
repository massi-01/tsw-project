# tsw-project

main folder contains two directories: java and webapp.
java folder contains the servlets and the models while webapp contains the jsp pages, the scripts and the stylesheets. 

in pom.xml there are all the plugins I've used until now. 

Project is still under development, so it may have some bugs.
